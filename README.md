# Push_swap

## Introduction
**Push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project where the objective is to sort a stack of integers using the minimum number of operations. The project challenges developers to implement efficient algorithms while adhering to strict constraints.

This project involves working with two stacks, a limited set of operations, and C programming to create a solution that outputs the smallest sequence of instructions needed to sort a stack.

## Objectives
- Understand sorting algorithms and complexity.
- Implement efficient solutions in C to solve sorting challenges.
- Learn to work under constraints, such as minimizing operations.
- Develop a thorough understanding of stack-based operations.

## Features
- Two-stack-based sorting mechanism (`a` and `b` stacks).
- A set of predefined operations:
  - **Swap operations**: `sa`, `sb`, `ss`
  - **Push operations**: `pa`, `pb`
  - **Rotate operations**: `ra`, `rb`, `rr`
  - **Reverse rotate operations**: `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`
- Support for error handling (e.g., invalid inputs, duplicates).
- Efficient sorting for up to 500 random integers with specific benchmarks:
  - **100 numbers**: ≤ 700 operations.
  - **500 numbers**: ≤ 5500 operations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd push_swap

2. Build the project using the provided Makefile:
  ```bash
  make

Usage

3. Run the program with a list of integers as input:
```bash
./push_swap 4 2 5 3 1

The output will be a sequence of operations to sort the stack:

pb
ra
sa
pa

To validate your sorting, you can use the checker program (see Bonus Features).
Examples
Example 1

Input:

./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8

Output:

sa
pb
pb
pb
sa
pa
pa
pa

Example 2 - Error Handling

    Non-integer input:

./push_swap 3 2 one 0

Output:

Error

Duplicate values:

./push_swap 4 4 3 2 1

Output:

    Error

## Bonus Features

The checker program validates the operations generated by push_swap:

    - Takes a list of integers and a sequence of operations as input.
    - Checks if the operations correctly sort the stack.

Example:

ARG="4 67 3 87 23"
./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG

If the operations are correct, the output will be:

OK

Otherwise, it will display:

KO

## Dependencies

    C compiler (gcc or equivalent).
    Standard C libraries (stdlib.h, stdio.h, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

    Ensure your input consists only of integers.
    Avoid duplicate integers in the input.
    Use make clean and make re to rebuild the project if issues arise.
